                <h2>Logo Design</h2>
                <h5>Developer <span>& Designer</span></h5>
                <p>A logo (or logotype) is a graphic, emblem, signature, or symbol used by businesses, 
                    organizations, and individuals to gain instant recognition. A subset of graphic design, 
                    logos are central elements that people identify with.</br></br>
                    A logo designer, therefore, creates an identifying mark, symbol, signature, 
                    or other graphics that identifies a business, company, organization, or another
                     enterprise in a way that is instantly discernible, and unforgettable.</br></br>
                     Before the design process begins, there must be a clear understanding of the concept or 
                     motive for the logo, along with the company or organization’s brand and values, as well as their
                      target group. Steps to the design process include research, conceptualization, sketching of ideas, 
                      refinement of design, testing, and finally production of the chosen logo.</br></br>
                      Logo designers are creative, artistic, and imaginative. They have strong design skills, 
                      but also the willingness to learn new techniques and competencies.</br></br>
                      Aspiring artist looking to become a logo designer must also have a thorough knowledge of online media,
                       the ability to multi-task, and sometimes work on more than one project (logo) at a time.
                        They must have strong interpersonal and organizational skills and manage their time well.
                         They have the ability to prioritize and meet deadlines and can communicate ideas and concepts 
                         so that anyone can easily understand. The design process can mean endless meetings, 
                         frequent conference calls, numerous emails, and many versions to complete, so patience
                          and stick-to-it-iveness are key traits to have.</br></br>
                        I work with Photoshop and Illustrator to create my designs.
